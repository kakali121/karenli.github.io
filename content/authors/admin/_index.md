Hi, I am a first year PhD student at REACT lab at Harvard University working with Prof. Stephanie Gil. Before joining REACT lab, I was an undergraduate researcher at Swarms Lab at Lehigh University and obtained my B.S. in CS in May 2024. My research interests include developing robust navigation and mapping methods in autonomous systems, especially in the context of swarms and multi-agent systems. I am also interested in exploring the applications of robotics in various fields such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue.
