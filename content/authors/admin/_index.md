Hi there, welcome to my page!

I am a first year PhD student at [REACT](https://react.seas.harvard.edu/) lab at Harvard University working with Prof. Stephanie Gil. My research interests include developing robust navigation and mapping methods in autonomous systems, especially in the context of multi-agent systems. I am also interested in exploring the applications of robotics in various fields such as environmental monitoring, search and rescue.


Before joining REACT lab, I was an undergraduate researcher at [Swarms](https://swarmslab.com/) Lab at Lehigh University working under Prof. David Saldaña. I obtained my B.S. in CS in May 2024.
